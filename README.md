<h1>React Todo App</h1>

A Todo app developed by React for learning and improving skills of React fundamentals especially useState() hook.

In this project, I basically created a Todo application to improve my React skills. I tried to practice and implement the useState() hook and props, which I see as the most important basic feature in React, to better understand them. 

In my Todo application, I first turned the inputs into controlled elements using useState(). I rendered the data I received from these input fields to the screen using a new component. Then I changed the todo's marked with the check button with the className manipulation and filtered them to the completed list. I filtered the uncomplete todos to the uncomplete list. Finally, I rendered the todos through this filtered object.

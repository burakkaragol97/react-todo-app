<h1>React Todo App</h1>

A Todo app developed by React for learning and improving skills of React fundamentals especially useState() hook.

In this project, I basically created a Todo application to improve my React skills. I tried to practice and implement the useState() hook and props, which I see as the most important basic feature in React, to better understand them.
